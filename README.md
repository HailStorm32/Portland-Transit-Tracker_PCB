These are the PCB files for the custom PCB that shows in real time what TriMet MAX stations have a train at them. Details regarding the code can be found <a href="https://github.com/HailStorm32/Portland-Transit-Tracker_Code">here</a>. More detail into how this was made, can be found <a href="https://www.vsickle.net/projects/trimet-transit-tracker.html">here</a>

V1 and V2.1 were both designed in Eagle. V2.1 is the version that was actually produced. 

For V2.1, the board was manufactuerd through <a href="https://jlcpcb.com/">JLCPCB</a>, and I solderd all the SMD componets.
